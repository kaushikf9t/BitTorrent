# BitTorrent File Transfer in a Peer to Peer Network
Implement the BitTorrent file transfer protocol 
BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. Among its interesting features, you are asked to implement the choking-unchoking mechanism which is one of the most important features of BitTorrent. In the following Protocol Descriptionsection, you can read  the  protocol  description,  which  has  been  modified  a little  bit  from  the  original BitTorrent protocol. After reading the protocol description carefully, you must follow the implementation specifics shown in the Implementation Specificssection.Protocol DescriptionThis  section  outlines  theprotocol  used  toestablish  the  file  management  operationsbetween peers. All operations are assumed to be implemented using a reliable transport protocol (i.e. TCP). The interaction between two peers is symmetrical:Messages sent in both directions look the same.The  protocol  consists  of  a  handshake  followed  by  a  never-ending  stream  of  length-prefixed messages. Whenever  a  connection  is  established  between  two  peers,  each  of  the  peers  of  the connection sends to the other one the handshake message before sending other messages
